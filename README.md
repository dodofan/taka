# TakaAntiCheat

Taka, also known as TakaAC or TakaAntiCheat, is a highly advanced anticheat; with its numerous checks, it has been made to stop hackers in the most effective way possible.
Taka has been in beta development for 2 years, and now I present you an advanced anticheat, which will prevent cheaters from harming your server and disrupting your players.
Every check is constantly being tested for bypasses and false positives before every update to guarantee, as best as possible, a quality anticheat that will serve your needs.
### **Issues with Taka should be reported in this repository.**

**Current Version:** 6.1.6 (3/16/2020).
